	<h1>Life Expectancy of the Most Impoverished Countries Compared to the U.S.</h1>

	<p id="ByLine">By Nicole Lopez</p>

</header>

<div id="introduction">
	<p>Impoverished nations still face low life expectancy compared to developed countries due to issues like lack of sanitation, insufficient technology, and warfare. However, thanks to aid provided by non-governmental organization’s like the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/05/529672-global-life-expectancy-five-years-2000-gains-uneven-un-health-agency">United Nations Organization</a> data shows an increase in life expectancy by an average of 5 years. Since 2005, the U.N. recorded data to calculate the Life Expectancy in over 200 countries and tracked the progress in 5 year increments. In these charts, we compare five countries with the lowest life expectancy and how this number has change over time. To get a better understanding how these countries compare to developed countries, we will also take a look at the life expectancy in the United States of America.</p>

<div id="conclusion">
	<p> As the figures above show, while there is a steady increase in the life expectancy of the five most impoverished countries, it would take decades before it gets close to developed countries. Hopefully, realizing this stark contrast will serve as a reminder of the need for non-governmental organizations like the <a href= "https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a>. The aid given to these countries is what will set them on the path to overcome life-threatening diseases,surive climate change, and increase food supply.</p>
